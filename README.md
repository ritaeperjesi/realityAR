## short documentation of my projects for Reality course

### the Dystopic eggs
I had a very nice image in my head about a white egg dipped into red paint from one side and green from the other one, representing the Hungarian flag. I also wanted to have it to lie in an augmented reality nest of disturbing Hungarian news. The communication of the Hungarian government is usually that everything is great, they are doing an amazing job, and as they are controlling the majority of media in Hungary, the opinion of the other side feels like it's just an augmented reality.
The execution of the eggpainting wasn't too successful, neither the AR part, but it was a good exercise.

And fun fact is that I'm working on an AR rainbow placed in the Hungarian Parliament as my protest against the government's discrimmination of LMBTQ people in Hungary.  

### Pop-up book
I have a book which contains one poem in 27 different languages. I really like this poem, I read it on a glass of Nutella, when I was on erasmus in Milan.

*Salvatore Quasimodo: And suddenly it's evening*

*Everyone stands alone at the heart of the world*

*pierced by a ray of sunlight*

*and suddenly itâ€™s evening.*

I'm fascinated by the picture of every human being connected to the sun with a sunbeam. Well, the half of the people on Earth.

### Something Big
We created this video with Milan Bargiel. 
Our concept was to take photos of the same things by day and night and use augmented reality to show another layer of time at the same space.

### Final project
I really like clouds, and I wanted to learn the name of the different types of clouds.
I used Unity, Adobe Aero and Adobe Premier Pro to create the augmented layer on the little book I drew.
