## short documentation of my projects for Reality course

### Easter egg
I had a very nice image in my head about a white egg

### Pop-up book
I have a book which contains one poem in 27 different languages. I really like this poem, I read it on a glass of Nutella, when I was on erasmus in Milan.

Salvatore Quasimodo: And suddenly it's evening
Everyone stands alone at the heart of the world
pierced by a ray of sunlight
and suddenly itâ€™s evening.

I'm fascinated by the picture of every human being connected to the sun with a sunbeam. Well, the half of the people on Earth.

### Something Big
We created this video with Milan Bargiel. 
Our concept was to take photos of the same things by day and night and use augmented reality to show another layer of time at the same space.

### Final project
I really like clouds, and I wanted to learn the name of the different types of clouds.
I used Unity, Adobe Aero and Adobe Premier Pro to create the augmented layer on the little book I drew.
